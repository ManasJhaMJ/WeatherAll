# WeatherAll

A weather dashboard that provides current weather forecasts along with 6+ information about the current weather. Utilizes OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities and incorporates localStorage to store data.

Note : As node modules would take up a lot of space, I chose not to upload it.

But as it is essential for the website to run, you can follow these steps to get node modules in it -


1.clone your repository

2.run "npm -i"

3.ng serve
